        <p>
            Welcome to the future of data sovereignty. We utilize a proprietary blend 
            of <strong>cryptographic protocols</strong> and <strong>decentralized fragmentation</strong> 
            to secure your digital assets. We don't just lock your files; we shatter them 
            and scatter the pieces across a secure network.
            <br><br>
            Your data is recoverable only by you, using a unique key generated on your device.

                <h3>1. Client-Side Locking</h3>
                <p>
                    Security starts on your device. Your files are locked securely before they 
                    ever leave your computer. This ensures that even our administrators 
                    cannot view your raw data.

                <h3>2. Data Fragmentation</h3>
                <p>
                    We split your locked data into unrecognizable "shards." These shards are 
                    distributed across independent storage nodes. A breach of one server 
                    yields only meaningless fragments, not your file.

                <h3>3. Digital Camouflage</h3>
                <p>
                    To prevent detection, your data fragments are embedded within ordinary 
                    digital assets. Your sensitive information effectively disappears into 
                    the digital noise of the internet.
