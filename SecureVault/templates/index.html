    <h1>Encrypt Once.<br>Recover Reliably.</h1>
    <p>
        SecureVault protects your files using <strong>client-side AES encryption</strong>,
        ensuring your data is secured before it ever leaves your device.
        <br><br>
        Instead of storing encryption keys in one place, we split, conceal,
        and distribute them—so your data stays safe and recoverable even if
        parts of the system fail.

            <h3>1. Local Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                Files are encrypted on the user’s device using a unique AES key.
                The encrypted file can be safely uploaded or stored, while the
                plaintext data never leaves the device.

            <h3>2. Key Splitting & Concealment</h3>
            <p>
                The encryption key is divided using a threshold scheme and each
                fragment is hidden inside ordinary images using steganography.
                Individual fragments reveal no useful information on their own.

            <h3>3. Redundant Distribution & Recovery</h3>
            <p>
                Concealed key fragments are redundantly distributed across
                multiple cloud locations. Even if some images are deleted or
                become unavailable, the key can still be reconstructed securely.
